## Description

## Features
- Job seekers can apply for jobs.
- Employers can review applications and provide feedback.
- Admin users can manage job positions and user roles.
- Secure authentication for job seekers and employers.
- Role-based access control.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Required to set up the database.
- **Gradle**: Required to build and run the project.
- **Postman**: Used for creating users and testing API endpoints.

### Steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VisiMihasi/JobPortal.git
   cd JobPortal

2. **Create the database:**

Navigate to the DOCKER directory and run the script to create the database.

bash

./DOCKER/Create-Database.sh  

3. **Build the project:**

Run the clean build command to ensure everything is set up correctly.


4. **./gradlew clean build**

Create users via Postman:

Open Postman and perform the following steps:

Create 1 Admin user
Create 11 Employer users
Create 14 Job Seeker users
You can use the provided Postman collection to automate the user creation process. Ensure the roles (ADMIN, EMPLOYER, JOB SEEKER) are assigned accordingly.


5. **Generate data:**

After creating the users, navigate to the DOCKER folder and execute the dump-file.sql to generate the necessary data in the database.

docker exec -i <your-container-name> mysql -u <username> -p <database-name> < DOCKER/dump-file.sql

6. **Run the application:**

Once the database is set up, and users are created, run the application.

bash
Copy
./gradlew bootRun
The server will start running on http://localhost:8080.
